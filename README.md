# scala-ts

Fork of scala-ts

Proposes an alternative way of doing thing in the scala parsing phase to scala-ts, notably for descending sealed trait hierarchies.

It's tailored internally for Elium usage, notably interfaces will be prefixed with IElium.

If this fork gains popularity, we can make it more configurable for general usage.
